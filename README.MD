## ScratchIt

A plugin that adds scratch cards to Minecraft servers.

## Compatibility

## How to compile

- Read and setup Paper-NMS plugin. [Read here](https://github.com/Alvinn8/paper-nms-maven-plugin).
- Run `mvn clean install` to compile the plugin.
- Get the JAR from the `scratchit-core/target/` folder.

# Contribute
- Implement 1.19.4+ NMS.
- Remove all pre-1.19.3 workarounds scattered around the code as I don't want to support legacy versions anymore.
- Read the various `TODO` in the project.
